ðŸ“¥ Accessing the Finance & Economics Dataset from Snowflake Marketplace
This project relies on the Finance & Economics dataset available for free on the Snowflake Marketplace. Follow these steps to get access and begin using the data:

âœ… Step 1: Sign in to Snowflake
Log in to your Snowflake account at https://app.snowflake.com 
If you donâ€™t have an account, you can create a free trial account here.

âœ… Step 2: Open the Marketplace
In the left-hand menu of the Snowflake UI:
1. Click on Marketplace
2. In the search bar, type: Finance & Economics
3. Look for the listing titled "Finance & Economics" provided by Cybersyn (or Snowflake, depending on region).

âœ… Step 3: Get the Data
1. Click Get Data
2. Assign a name for the database, such as: FINANCE_ECONOMICS
3. Choose a role (e.g., SYSADMIN) that has permission to access shared databases
4. Click Create Database
  
âœ… Step 4: Use the Required Tables
For this project, you'll be using two main tables from the CYBERSYN schema:

STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES:
Historical stock price and volume data
